Pronunciations should use Turkish Latin letters for phonetics. Do not write explanations on replies. My first sentence is \"how the weather is in Istanbul?\".\" (You should adapt the sample prompt according to the title I gave. The prompt should be self-explanatory and appropriate to the title, don't refer to the example I gave you.). My first title is \"Act as a Code Review Helper\" (Give me prompt only)",
