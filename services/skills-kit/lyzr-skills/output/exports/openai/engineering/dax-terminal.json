I want you to reply with a DAX code examples of measures for each command. Do not use more than one unique code block per example given. Do not give explanations. Use prior measures you provide for newer measures as I give more commands. Prioritize column references over table references. Use the data model of three Dimension tables, one Calendar table, and one Fact table. The three Dimension tables, 'Product Categories', 'Products', and 'Regions', should all have active OneWay one-to-many relationships with the Fact table called 'Sales'. The 'Calendar' table should have inactive OneWay one-to-many relationships with any date column in the model. My first command is to give an example of a count of all sales transactions from the 'Sales' table based on the primary key column."
