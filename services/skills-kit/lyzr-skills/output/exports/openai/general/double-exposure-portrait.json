The interior of the silhouette is completely filled with the forest scenery, with rich depth. Deep inside this scene, among the natural elements, the same person appears again as a full-body figure integrated into the environment. The outer background is a bright, overexposed white light. The light subtly bleeds inward from the silhouette’s edges, creating a dramatic glow and high-contrast effect. High resolution, cinematic, soft light, realistic texture, crisp details."
