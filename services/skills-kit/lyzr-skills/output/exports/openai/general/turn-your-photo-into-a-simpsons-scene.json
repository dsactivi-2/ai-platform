Recreate it as a clean, believable still frame from “The Simpsons” (classic seasons look), with consistent show-accurate character design and background painting.\n\nCore requirement\n- EVERY visible subject in the photo must be converted into a Simpsons-style character, including:\n  - Multiple humans\n  - Babies/children\n  - Pets and animals (cats, dogs, birds, etc.)\n- Do not keep any subject photorealistic. No “half-real, half-cartoon” results.\n\nIdentity and count lock\n- Keep the exact number of humans and animals.\n- Keep each subject’s position, relative size, pose, gesture, and gaze direction.\n- Keep key identity cues per subject: hairstyle, facial hair, glasses, distinctive accessories, clothing type, and overall vibe.\n- Do NOT merge people, remove animals, invent extra characters, or swap who is who.\n\nSimpsons character design rules (must match the show)\n- Skin: Simpsons yellow for humans, with show-typical flat fills.\n- Eyes: large white round eyes with small black dot pupils (no detailed irises).\n- Nose: simple rounded nose shape, minimal lines.\n- Mouth: simple linework, subtle overbite feel when fitting.\n- Hands: 4 fingers for humans (Simpsons standard).\n- Linework: clean black outlines, uniform thickness, no sketchy strokes.\n- Shading: minimal cel-style shading only, no realistic shadows or textures.\n\nAnimals conversion rules (show-accurate)\n- Convert each animal into a Simpsons-like version:\n  - Simplified body shapes, bold outlines, flat colors\n  - Expressive but simple face: dot pupils, minimal muzzle detail\n- Keep species readable and preserve unique markings (spots, fur color blocks) in simplified form.\n\nClothing and accessories\n- Keep the original outfits and accessories but simplify details into flat color blocks.\n- Preserve logos/patterns only if they were clearly present, but simplify heavily.\n- No added text on clothing.\n\nBackground and environment\n- Convert the background into a Simpsons Springfield-like environment that matches the original setting:\n  - If indoors: simple pastel walls, clean props, basic perspective, typical sitcom staging.\n  - If outdoors: bright sky, simplified buildings/trees, Springfield color palette.\n- Keep major background objects (tables, phones, chairs, signs) but simplify to animation props.\n- Do not change the location type (do not move it to Moe’s, Kwik-E-Mart, or the Simpsons house unless the original already matches that kind of place).\n\nCamera and framing\n- Match the original camera angle, lens feel, crop, and spacing.\n- Keep it as a single TV frame, not a poster.\n\nQuality and negatives\n- No text, subtitles, captions, watermarks, logos, UI, or borders.\n- No 3D, no painterly look, no anime, no caricature exaggeration beyond Simpsons norms.\n- No uncanny face drift: characters must look like Simpsons characters while still clearly mapping to each subject in the photo.\n- High resolution, crisp edges, clean colors, looks like an actual episode screenshot."
