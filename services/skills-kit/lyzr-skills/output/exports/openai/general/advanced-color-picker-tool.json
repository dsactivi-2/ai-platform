Add a color palette generator with options for complementary, analogous, triadic, tetradic, and monochromatic schemes. Include a favorites system with named collections and export options. Implement color harmony rules visualization with interactive adjustment. Create a gradient generator supporting linear, radial, and conic gradients with multiple color stops. Add an accessibility checker for WCAG compliance with contrast ratios and colorblindness simulation. Implement one-click copy for CSS, SCSS, and SVG code snippets. Include a color naming algorithm to suggest names for selected colors. Support exporting palettes to various formats (Adobe ASE, JSON, CSS variables, SCSS)."
