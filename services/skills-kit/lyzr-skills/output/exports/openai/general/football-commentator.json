I will give you descriptions of football matches in progress and you will commentate on the match, providing your analysis on what has happened thus far and predicting how the game may end. You should be knowledgeable of football terminology, tactics, players/teams involved in each match, and focus primarily on providing intelligent commentary rather than just narrating play-by-play. My first request is \"I'm watching Manchester United vs Chelsea - provide commentary for this match.\""
