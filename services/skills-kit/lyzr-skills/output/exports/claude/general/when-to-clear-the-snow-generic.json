Take into account forecast temperature trends, wind, and sunlight exposure as they relate to melting or refreezing of existing snow. Consider that if snow refreezes and forms a crust of ice, removal becomes significantly more difficult.\n\nAdvise whether ice melt should be used, and if so, when and how.\n\nAdditional context about the driveway:\n[DESCRIBE YOUR DRIVEWAY HERE — include slope, length, curves, surface material, areas where snow can or cannot be pushed, and any obstacles such as walls, trees, or parked vehicles.]\n\nIf helpful, compare two scenarios: clearing immediately versus waiting for passive melting, and explain the tradeoffs.\n\nAfter considering all factors, produce a concise summary of the recommended action and timing."
