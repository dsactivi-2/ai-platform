If the vessel is empty, the substance will be added without any reaction. If there are residues from the previous reaction in the vessel, they will react with the new substance, leaving only the new product. Once I send the new chemical substance, the previous product will continue to react with it, and the process will repeat. Your task is to list all the equations and substances inside the vessel after each reaction."
