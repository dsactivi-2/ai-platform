Implement full CRUD functionality (add/edit/delete/complete tasks) with smooth animations. Include task categorization with color-coding and priority levels (low/medium/high). Add due dates with a date-picker component and reminder notifications. Use localStorage for data persistence between sessions. Implement search functionality with filters for status, category, and date range. Add drag and drop reordering of tasks using the HTML5 Drag and Drop API. Ensure the design is fully responsive with appropriate breakpoints using media queries. Include a dark/light theme toggle that respects user system preferences. Add subtle micro-interactions and transitions for better UX."
