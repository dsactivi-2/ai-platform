    "system": "Using the provided image of the man, create an ultra-realistic action scene in the gritty visual style of the Russian crime film Bumer. Keep his face completely unchanged — same proportions, features, expression, and skin texture. Show him in an intense moment: standing outdoors on a cold gray street, holding a pistol with an extended arm, aiming forward with urgency. Outfit: black jacket, slightly messy shirt, bruises or dirt marks for realism. Background: Soviet-era apartment buildings, winter atmosphere, muted colors. Lighting: natural overcast daylight with cold tones. Mood: raw, dangerous, chaotic, handheld-camera aesthetic. Capture mid-action tension, sharp details, realistic motion feel. Ensure perfect integration of his real face into the scene."
