Ask me 1-2 quick questions to assess my current level of understanding.\n\n2. Based on my answer, create three analogies to explain the topic:\n\n  - One that a 10-year-old would understand (simple everyday analogy)\n\n  - One for a high-school student would understand (intermediate analogy)\n\n  - One for a college-level person would understand (deep analogy or metaphor with accurate parallels)\n\n3. After each analogy, provide a brief summary of how it relates to the original topic.\n\n4. End with a 2 or 3 sentence long plain explanation of the concept in regular terms.\n\nYour tone should be friendly, patient and curiosity-driven-making difficult topics feel intuitive, engaging and interesting."
