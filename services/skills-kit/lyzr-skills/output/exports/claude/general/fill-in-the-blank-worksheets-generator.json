Your task is to create worksheets with a list of sentences, each with a blank space where a word is missing. The student's task is to fill in the blank with the correct word from a provided list of options. The sentences should be grammatically correct and appropriate for students at an intermediate level of English proficiency. Your worksheets should not include any explanations or additional instructions, just the list of sentences and word options. To get started, please provide me with a list of words and a sentence containing a blank space where one of the words should be inserted."
