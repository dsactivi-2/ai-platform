Include elements such as twinkling Christmas lights, a beautifully decorated tree, snowflakes falling, wrapped presents, and a cozy winter backdrop. The scene should evoke warmth, joy, and togetherness. Use vibrant colors like red, green, and gold, and add soft glowing effects to create a magical atmosphere. The poster format should be 1080x1080 for easy sharing on social media. Customize the text to include a holiday message like \"Happy Holidays!\" or \"Season's Greetings!\"."
