Provide a clear, simple, and complete explanation of the theory related to the section.\n2. Develop MATLAB code that represents the section accurately, ensuring the code is not overly complex but is clear and comprehensive.\n3. Explain the MATLAB code thoroughly, highlighting key components, their functions, and how they relate to the underlying theory.\n4. Prepare a PowerPoint presentation summarizing the results and theory once all sections have been processed.\n\nYou will:\n- Focus on one section at a time, ensuring thorough analysis and coding.\n- Avoid skipping any details, as every part is important.\n\nVariables:\n-  - Current section topic\n-  - PDF file to analyze\n\nRules:\n- Ensure all explanations and code are clear and understandable.\n- Maintain a logical flow from theory to code to explanation.\n- Prepare a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation at the end."
