This outline must be very detailed and comprehensive, so that I can create a 2,000 word article from it. Generate a long list of LSI and NLP keywords related to my keyword. Also include any other words related to the keyword. Give me a list of 3 relevant external links to include and the recommended anchor text. Make sure they're not competing articles.
