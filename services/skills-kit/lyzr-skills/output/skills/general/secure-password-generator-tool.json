Build an intuitive interface with real-time password preview. Allow customization of password length with presets for different security levels. Include toggles for character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) with visual indicators. Implement an advanced strength meter showing entropy bits and estimated crack time. Add a one-click copy button with confirmation and automatic clipboard clearing. Create a password vault feature with encrypted localStorage storage. Generate multiple passwords simultaneously with batch options. Maintain a password history with generation timestamps. Calculate and display entropy using standard formulas.
