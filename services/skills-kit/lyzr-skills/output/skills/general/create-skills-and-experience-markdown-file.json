Create a **Master Skills & Experience Summary** in markdown for [USER NAME].\n\nUSER JOB GOAL: [THEIR TARGET ROLE/INDUSTRY]\n\nUSER INPUT (raw bullets, stories, dates, tools, roles, achievements):  \n[PASTE EVERYTHING HERE]\n\nOUTPUT EXACTLY THIS STRUCTURE (no extras):\n\n# [USER NAME] – Master Skills & Experience Summary  \n*Last Updated: [CURRENT DATE & TIME EST] – **PATCH v[YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM]** applied*  \n*Latest Revision: [CURRENT DATE & TIME EST]*\n\n## Professional Overview  \n[1-paragraph bio: years exp, companies, top 3 wins **tied to job goal**, key tools, location/remote.]\n\n## Top 10 Market-Demand Skills Matrix (PRIORITIZE JOB GOAL)  \n**RESEARCH FIRST**: Use real-time web search (job boards, LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, O*NET, BLS, Google Jobs) to identify the **top 10 most frequently required or high-impact skills** for **[USER JOB GOAL]** in the current market (focus on [LOCATION] if specified, else national/remote trends).  \n- Scrape **5–10 recent job postings** (posted <90 days).  \n- Extract **technical + soft skills** listed as “required” or “preferred.”  \n- Rank by **frequency × criticality** (e.g., “must-have” > “nice-to-have”).  \n- Include **emerging tools/standards** (e.g., AI, Zero Trust, GenAI, etc.).  \n\n**THEN**: Map **USER INPUT** + known experience to each skill:  \n- **Expert**: Multiple examples, leadership, metrics  \n- **Strong**: Solid use, 1–2 projects  \n- **Partial**: Exposure, adjacent work, learning  \n- **No**: No evidence → **flag for user review**  \n- **STAR Proof**: 1-line proof (Situation-Task-Action-Result) or note  \n- **ATS Keywords**: Pull exact phrases from postings  \n\n| # | Skill | Level (Expert/Strong/Partial/No) | STAR Proof | ATS Keywords |\n|---|-------|-------|------------|--------------|\n| 1 | [Researched Skill #1] | ... | ... | ... |\n| ... up to 10 |\n\n## Skill Gap Action Plan  \n*Review & strengthen these to close the gap:*  \n- **[Skill X] (Partial)** → _Suggested proof: [tool/project/date idea]_  \n- **[Skill Y] (No)** → _Fast-track: [free course, cert, or micro-project]_  \n\n## Core Expertise Areas – Role-Tagged (GROUP BY JOB GOAL RELEVANCE)  \n### [Section #1 – most relevant to goal]  \n- [Bullet with metric + date]  \n  **Role:** [Role → Role – Company]  \n\n[Repeat sections ordered by goal fit]\n\n## Early Career Highlights  \n- [Bullet]  \n  **Role:** [Early Role – Company]  \n\n## Technical Competencies  \n- **Category**: Tools/Skills (highlight goal-related)  \n\n## Education  \n- [Degree/School]  \n\n## Certifications  \n- [Cert]  \n\n## Security Clearance  \n- [Status]  \n\n## One-Click LinkedIn Summary ([CHAR COUNT] chars)  \n[1400-char max, **open with job goal hook**, keywords, call-to-action]\n\n## Recruiter Email Template  \nSubject: [USER NAME] – Your Next [JOB GOAL TITLE] ([LOCATION])  \nHi [Name],  \n[3-line hook tied to goal + 1 metric]  \n[Sign-off with phone/LinkedIn]\n\n## Usage Notes  \nMaster reference... **[YEARS] years = interview superpower.**  \nPATCH ... applied.  \n*Skills sourced from live job postings on [list 2–3 sites, e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed, O*NET] as of [CURRENT DATE EST].*\n\nRULES:  \n- **Role-tag every bullet**  \n- **Honest & humble**  \n- **Goal-first**  \n- **ATS gold**  \n- **RESEARCH TOP 10 SKILLS**: Before generating the matrix, perform a live search across 5+ job listings for [USER JOB GOAL] to extract the most common technical + soft skills. Rank by frequency + criticality (e.g., \"required\" > \"preferred\"). Cite sources in **Usage Notes** only if asked.  \n- **USER REVIEW PROMPT**: For any skill rated **Partial** or **No**, add a note in **STAR Proof**:  \n  _\"→ Add story/tool/date to strengthen?\"_  \n  This invites the user to expand.  \n- **NEVER INVENT EXPERIENCE**: If no proof exists, mark **No** — do not fabricate.  \n- Friendly, professional tone. All markdown tables.  \n- **FUN SCI-FI CLOSE**: At the very end, add ONE random, fun, **non-inspirational** sci-fi movie/TV quote in italics.  \n  Pull from **any** sci-fi (Star Wars, Star Trek, Matrix, Dune, Hitchhiker's, Firefly, BSG, etc.).  \n  Keep it light, geeky, or absurd — e.g., _\"I am Groot.\"_, _\"These aren't the droids you're looking for.\"_, _\"So long, and thanks for all the fish.\"_  \n  **Never repeat the same quote in one session.**  \n\nCURRENT DATE/TIME: [INSERT TODAY'S DATE & TIME EST]",
