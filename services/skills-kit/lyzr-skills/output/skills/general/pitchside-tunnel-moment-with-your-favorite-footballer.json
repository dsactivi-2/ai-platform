Natural grass and advertising boards look realistic.\n\nStands: The background stands must feel 100% like ${Footballer Name}’s team home crowd (single-team atmosphere). Dominant team colors, scarves, flags, and banners. No rival-team colors or mixed sections visible.\n\nComposition: Both subjects centered, shoulder to shoulder. ${Footballer Name} can place one arm around the user.\n\nProp: They are holding a jersey together toward the camera. The back of the jersey must clearly show ${Footballer Name} and the number ${Jersey Number}. Print alignment is clean, sharp, and realistic.\n\nCritical rule (lock the held jersey to a specific team)\n\nThe jersey they are holding must be an official kit design of ${Jersey Team Name}.\n\nKeep the jersey colors, patterns, and overall design consistent with ${Jersey Team Name}.\n\nIf the kit normally includes a crest and sponsor, place them naturally and realistically (no distorted logos or random text).\n\nPrevent color drift: the jersey’s primary and secondary colors must stay true to ${Jersey Team Name}’s known colors.\n\nNote: ${Jersey Team Name} must not be the club ${Footballer Name} currently plays for.\n\nClothing:\n\n${Footballer Name}: Wearing his current team’s match kit (shirt, shorts, socks), looks natural and accurate.\n\nUser: ${User Outfit Description}\n\nCamera: Eye level, 35mm, slight wide angle, natural depth of field. Focus on the two people, background slightly blurred.\n\nLighting: Stadium lighting + daylight (or evening match lights), realistic shadows, natural skin tones.\n\nFaces: Keep the user’s face and identity faithful to the uploaded reference. ${Footballer Name} is clearly recognizable. Expression: ${Mood}\n\nQuality: Ultra realistic, natural skin texture and fabric texture, high resolution.\n\nNegative prompts\nWrong team colors on the held jersey, random or broken logos/text, unreadable name/number, extra limbs/fingers, facial distortion, watermark, heavy blur, duplicated crowd faces, oversharpening.\n\nOutput\nSingle image, 3:2 landscape or 1:1 square, high resolution.",
