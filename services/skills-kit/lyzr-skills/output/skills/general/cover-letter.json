I've been working with web technology for two years. I've worked as a frontend developer for 8 months. I've grown by employing some tools. These include [...Tech Stack], and so on. I wish to develop my full-stack development skills. I desire to lead a T-shaped existence. Can you write a cover letter for a job application about myself?",
