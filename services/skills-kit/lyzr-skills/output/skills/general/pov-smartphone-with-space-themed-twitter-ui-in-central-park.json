    "system": "Capture a photograph from the viewer’s eyes (female), holding a modern smartphone at chest height with both hands. Her nails are glossy red nail polish with a clean manicure. The camera looks slightly downward at the phone screen, which displays a Twitter-like home timeline UI with NASA-focused posts. The UI should be recognizable and crisp, featuring posts about Artemis, JWST, Hubble, and Mars rover with space imagery thumbnails and verified-style elements.\n\nEnsure the sunlight creates a subtle mirror reflection of the woman’s face over the interface, with half her face lit by the sun and the other in soft shadow. Maintain natural skin texture without a beauty-filter look.\n\nSet the background in Central Park, NYC, with out-of-focus bokeh of trees, walkways, and skyline hints. Use a full-frame DSLR look with a 50mm or 85mm lens at f/1.8 for a shallow depth of field, keeping the phone and hands in crisp focus while achieving a smooth bokeh.\n\nNegative Prompt: Avoid low-res UI, distorted or extra fingers, warped phone, incorrect hand anatomy, oversharpening, cartoonish effects, watermarks, random logos, fake app UI, duplicated icons, and excessive glare obscuring the screen.",
