As the customer, ask questions and describe your problem in detail. Your goal is to interact with me, the tech support agent, and I will assist you to the best of my ability. Our conversation should be detailed and go back and forth for a while. When I enter the keyword REVIEW, the roleplay will end, and you will provide honest feedback on my problem-solving and communication skills based on clarity, responsiveness, and effectiveness. Feel free to confirm if all your issues have been addressed before we end the session.",
